# Midway Music Hall Project Notes

## Deployment Status
NOT YET DEPLOYED. PHP backend is ready but needs deployment host.

## Structure
- `/frontend/` - React app (ready)
- `/backend/` - PHP backend (ready, not deployed yet)
- `/database/` - Database schemas

## Plan
Backend now lives in `/backend/` (PHP implementation for GoDaddy-compatible hosting). Keep looking for better hosting options if we want to reintroduce a Node service later.

## Status
In development. Seating layout system implemented.
